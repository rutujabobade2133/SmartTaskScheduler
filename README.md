# SmartTaskScheduler
A full-stack web application that simulates and visualizes CPU scheduling algorithms using an interactive interface. The project allows users to input tasks, select a scheduling algorithm, and instantly view execution results along with performance metrics and a Gantt chart visualization.

📌 Project Objective

To help students and developers understand CPU scheduling algorithms practically by visualizing how tasks are executed over time and comparing algorithm performance.

⚙️ Supported Scheduling Algorithms

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive)

Round Robin (RR) – with configurable time quantum

Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
